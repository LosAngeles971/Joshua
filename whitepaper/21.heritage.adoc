== The heritage

[quote, anonymous]
____
A person gets an heritage of 1024â‚¬, and it starts spending half of the amount each day. How many days does he take to stay with less than 1 euro?
____

This simple mathematical problem is interesting because the representing graph is different from that of the problem "The farmer, the wolf, the goat and the cabbage". 

Describing it is pretty fast:

* the solution's event is: "He has less than 1 euro"
* the others events:
** One day of spending
** The inheritance is halved

Three cause-effect relationships are enough.

|Cause

|One day of spending
|The inheritance is halved
|1.0

|One day of spending
|He has less than 1 euro
|0.5

|The inheritance is halved
|He has less than 1 euro
|0.5

|===

Note how this problem:

* there is an always true relationship, indeed when he has one day of spending, then the inheritance is always halved
* there is one event that is the cause of multiple effects

Finally, for this problem the state contains only one variable:

* Inheritance = 1024
