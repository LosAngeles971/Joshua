Above table shows the cause-relationships that Joshua tried to reach the desired effect.

The brutal force approach is recognizable by all attempts with the outcome "cause not happened".
Indeed, the outcome "cause not happened" means that a cause-effect relationship cannot happen, since its cause cannot occur, usually because the cause requires a state that is not there. 
For example the very first attempt is the cause-effect "The farmer brings the cabbage on the bank B of the river", the latter cannot happen, because the farmer would left the wolf and the goat alone.

Differently, the outcome "effect not happened" means that the cause of the cause-effect relationship happened, but not the effect.
For example, at the cycle 1 the cause "The farmer brings the goat on the bank B of the river" occurred, but the effect (the problem's solution) did not yet (since the effect requires a specific state to occur).

If you clean the table of all foolish attempt, you have a clean path of cause-effect occurrences.
