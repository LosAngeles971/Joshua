I am not afraid of how much a machine can look like a human being, but how much a human being can be assimilated to a complex machine.

Joshua is a software. 
It was born from an inspiration coming from reading a book, and its purpose is solving generics problems using a combination of knowledge and state. The knowledge consists of events, and relationships between events. An event is something that can occur under certain circumstances, like a concept (it is always true, for example "Fred is a frog") or an action (it may occur or not, like "the farmer crosses the river"). A relationship ties two events under the principle of cause-effect. Finally, the state is a set of variables which can determine if an event can occur, as well as the occurrence of events can change the state.
